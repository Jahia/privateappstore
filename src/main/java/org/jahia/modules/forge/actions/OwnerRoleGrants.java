/**
 * Grants the {@code owner} role to the uploading user on the nodes an upload just created —
 * using a <em>system</em> session, so the {@code store-developer} role does not need
 * {@code jcr:modifyAccessControl_live} to make an upload work (SEC-366 / GHSA-f882-3xwv-3439).
 *
 * <p><strong>Why elevation and not a grant.</strong> Before SEC-366 the role shipped
 * {@code jcr:modifyAccessControl_live} at <em>site</em> scope so that
 * {@code node.grantRoles(...)} would succeed in the caller's own live session (commit
 * {@code 25db344}, "APPS-14 fixed issue when new node is created with just upload rights").
 * Site-scoped live ACL authority is far more than the upload needs: it let a store developer
 * rewrite the site's live ACL, self-promote to {@code store-administrator} and strip the
 * site administrators — invisibly, because a live write never enters a publication queue.
 * The upload needs ACL authority on the handful of nodes it just created, so that is all it
 * gets, and it gets it from the platform rather than from the caller's role.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why the grants are deferred.</strong> Both upload paths grant the owner role on
 * nodes that are still transient in the caller's session. A system session cannot see those,
 * so callers {@link #record(JCRNodeWrapper)} each node as it is created and
 * {@link #flush()} once the caller's session has been saved.
 *
 * <p><strong>Invariants enforced on every elevated write</strong> — an elevated write is only
 * as safe as the constraints around it, so all four are checked here rather than assumed:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the principal is the caller's own username, never a parameter;</li>
 *   <li>the role is the constant {@code owner}, never a caller-supplied name;</li>
 *   <li>the target is re-resolved <em>by identifier</em> in the system session — never by a
 *       path built from user input;</li>
 *   <li>the target must live under the repository node the action was invoked on, which the
 *       Action framework already gated with {@code jahiaForgeUploadModule}
 *       ({@code CreateEntryFromJar.activate()}). A node outside that subtree is refused, so
 *       this helper can never be repurposed to grant owner anywhere else in the site.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Not thread-safe, and not meant to be: one instance belongs to one upload request.
