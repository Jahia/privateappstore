/**
 * Regression coverage for GHSA-f882-3xwv-3439 / SEC-366.
 *
 * The `store-developer` role — granted to everyone allowed to upload a module — shipped
 * `jcr:modifyAccessControl_live` at site scope. A store developer could therefore rewrite the
 * site's LIVE access-control list: promote themselves to `store-administrator`, promote an
 * unrelated third party, or remove the site administrators' own entry. Because the write landed
 * in `live` it never entered a publication queue, so an administrator inspecting the ACL through
 * the editing UI saw an intact list.
 *
 * The advisory's proof-of-concept is reused here as the test design, with the expectation of the
 * attack arm inverted. Two things it established are load-bearing for how this spec asserts:
 *
 *   1. **Every arm answered HTTP 200.** The status code is never the discriminator, so nothing
 *      here asserts on one.
 *   2. **The escalation was measured, not inferred**, via `hasPermission` in the developer's own
 *      session — a 0 -> 1 -> 0 across grant and cleanup. This spec keeps that discipline: the
 *      refusals are only meaningful alongside the positive-control arm below, which proves the
 *      mutation and the probe both still work. Without it, a spec broken for an unrelated reason
 *      (a renamed schema field, say) would report two reassuring `false`s and pass.
 *
 * Identity note: as in `21-permissions.cy.ts`, GraphQL identity is the apollo client's Basic-auth
 * header (`cy.apolloClient`), not the browser session.
